The DriverPass project was all about designing a system for our client who wanted to help their customers book driving lessons, access learning materials, and track their progress. They needed an easy-to-use system where the students(customers) could schedule lessons, view course content, get feedback, and see their progress over time.


I think I did a good job of breaking down the system’s use cases and workflows in a way that made sense for the client and the students who would use it.My focus was on making the system feel easy and natural to navigate. If I could go back and revise one part of my work, I’d choose to add more details to the user interface section. I think adding extra visuals or simpler explanations could make it even easier for all users to understand and interact with the system.


To figure out the user’s needs, I looked closely at each requirement the client mentioned and made sure I included it in the design. For example, since students needed an easy way to book lessons and see their progress, I made sure these options were front and center in the system. Understanding the user’s needs is essential because it directly impacts how well the system works and how much people will actually want to use it.


When I design software, I like to start by getting a solid understanding of what the users need and what the system should accomplish. In the future, I’d focus on getting early feedback from users, maybe through simple prototypes or user flow diagrams, to make sure I’m on the right track. I’d also keep using feedback and iteration as key strategies, since they help create a system that truly fits the user’s needs.
